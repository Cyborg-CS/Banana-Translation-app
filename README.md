# Minion-Language Translator Web-app.

Made this really cool and fun minion translator web-app by using HTML, CSS and VanillaJS during the LevelZero bootcamp classes of neoG.camp .

Thought this would be fun to host it online and turned out to be 
really cool. Make sure to share this to your friends and have fun together ;)
